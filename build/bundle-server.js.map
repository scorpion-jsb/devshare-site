If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality.
